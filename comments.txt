Your code ran without any interruption in my computer.
You inspected the data well.
Placing files within folders would have been made it easy to access and better understand them.
The graphs look good with proper labeling.
Overall, the data inspection was thorough, processing and visualization of the data was well explained. Good work with the assignment!
